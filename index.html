        Hey There!<br />
        I am an ASE at TCS and have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Sinhgad Academy of Engineering in Pune. Computers have always fascinated me since I was a child. During my one year at TCS, I was able to work on
        testing
        and technical support projects. I've recently developed an interest in web development and am learning more about it. When I'm not working, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends.
        In my spare time, I have a YouTube channel where I post gaming videos.
